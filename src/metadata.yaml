summary: Federated identity with SAML via Mellon Service Provider
description: The main goal of this charm is to generate the necessary configuration
  for use in the Keystone charm related to Service Provider config generation, trust
  establishment between a remote idP and SP via certificates and signaling Keystone
  service restart. Keystone has a concept of a federated backend which serves multiple
  purposes including being a backend part of a Service Provider in an authentication
  scenario where SAML is used. Unless ECP is used on a keystone client side, SAML-related
  exchange is performed in an Apache authentication module (Mellon in case of this
  charm) and SAML assertions are converted to WSGI environment variables passed down
  to a particular mod_wsgi interpreter running Keystone code. Keystone has an authentication
  plug-in called "mapped" which does the rest of the work of resolving symbolic attributes
  and using them in mappings defined by an operator or validating the existence of
  referenced IDs.

      Identity Provider metadata XML file that conforms to

      identification information and its certificates with public keys
      that can be used for signing and encryption on the idP side in
      IDPSSODescriptor and other information which can be used on the
      service provider side to interact with that idP.

    description: |
      Specifies a signing KeyInfo portion of SPSSODescriptor to be used
      in Service Provider metadata. This should be an XML portion
      which in the simplest case is formatted as shown below:
      This fragment should contain a certificate that contains a public
      key of a Service Provider in case an idP requires that SAML
      requests are signed.
      The term "signing certificate" is a misnomer. A signing
      certificate in metadata is actually used for signature
      verification, not signing. The private signing key is held
      securely by the signing party (SP in this case). In a SAML
      exchange an SP signs SAML messages with its private key and idP
      validates them via a public key embedded in a certificate present
      in the SP's metadata XML and vice versa for idP.
